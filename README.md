RSA and CRT implementation

Implemented the standard RSA algorithm,
understanding its deficiency and to further optimize it through combining the RSA algorithm with Chinese
Remainder Theorem to speed up RSA decryption by an
approximate factor of four. Both the implementations are done in Java.

We then compare and analyse the performance of the variant for which graphs have been attatched.

The RSA-CRT variant is backwards compatible in the sense that a
system using it can interoperate with systems using standard RSA.

In future, a GUI to convert text is required.
